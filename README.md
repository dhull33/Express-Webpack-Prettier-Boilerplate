# Express-Webpack-Prettier-Boilerplate

Boilerplate intended to help you get started with Express, Webpack, and Prettier using Airbnb's Javascript Guidelines.

#### JavaScript Style Guidelines

We are using Airbnb's JavaScript GuideLine with Eslint, EditorConfig, and Prettier in order to
standardize our code while writing it however you want to. I have made things such that your code
will be re-formatted once it is staged for a commit (git add .) and will receive alerts about
potential bugs and errors. I have tried to set things up in order to make it as easy as possible
for everyone to use. However, there is always something that inevitably goes wrong. Also, it
will probably be frustrating while you are getting used to the new coding style.
Please follow the instructions below and it should be as painless a process as possible.

#### Resources

- [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guidlines](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- [ESLint Docs](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)
- [Prettier Docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html)
- [Prettier Ignore Reformatting](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html)
- [Editor Config](https://editorconfig.org/#download)

#### Setting Up EditorConfig

1. Go to [editorconfig.org](https://editorconfig.org/#download) and download the plugin for your
   development environment.
2. That's it! I have already set up the .editorconfig file in our repository

#### Setting Up Everything Else

1. `npm install`
2. You're done! Now all you have to do is stage your files for commit and they will be
   reformatted before being committed and pushed to GitHub.

#### File Watching

- If you would rather have your code be reformatted as you make changes to it while the app is
  running locally you can run `npm start` and everything should work!
