Boilerplate intended to help you get started with Express, Webpack, and Prettier using Google's Javascript Guidelines.

### Installation

`$ npm install -g a-dope-boilerplate`

### Get Started

Create your project in the current working directory:

`$ a-dope-boilerplate`

#### Resources

- [ESLint Docs](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)
- [Prettier Docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html)
- [Prettier Ignore Reformatting](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html)
- [Editor Config](https://editorconfig.org/#download)

#### Setting Up EditorConfig

1. Go to [editorconfig.org](https://editorconfig.org/#download) and download the plugin for your
   development environment.
2. That's it! I have already set up the .editorconfig file in our repository

#### Setting Up Everything Else

1. `npm install`
2. You're done! Now all you have to do is stage your files for commit, and they will be
   reformatted before being committed and pushed to GitHub.

#### File Watching

- If you would rather have your code be reformatted as you make changes to it while the app is
  running locally you can run `npm start` and everything should work!

#### Issues and Requests

If you find any bugs or would like to request a feature head over to [the issue tracker](https://github.com/dhull33/Express-Webpack-Prettier-Boilerplate/issues).
